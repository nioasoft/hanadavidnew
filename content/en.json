        "I'm Hana David, and I bring a lifelong passion for languages and teaching to every lesson.",
        "Born and raised in the United States, I developed a deep love for reading and languages from an early age. I studied history, foreign languages (French, Latin, Russian, and Spanish), and creative writing at the University of Memphis, while also volunteering to teach English to new immigrants.",
        "After making aliyah to Israel in 2019, I pursued my dream of becoming a professional English teacher. In January 2025, I completed the prestigious CELTA certification (Certificate in English Language Teaching to Adults), where I was mentored by experienced EFL teachers and taught students from around the world.",
        "During my training, I received high marks for creating authentic, engaging lesson materials, building strong connections with students, and designing relevant, practical lessons that make learning enjoyable.",
        "Over the past five years, I have had the privilege of working with a diverse range of students—from high-tech professionals aiming to polish their presentation skills to university students preparing for rigorous academic exams. My approach blends Communicative Language Teaching with task-based learning, ensuring that every grammar point or vocabulary word is immediately applicable to real-life situations.",
        "One of my proudest moments was helping a student who was terrified of public speaking deliver a keynote address in English at an international conference. Seeing his transformation from anxiety to confidence reaffirmed my belief that with the right support, anyone can master English.",
        "Now, I'm dedicated to helping you achieve your English goals through personalized, one-on-one instruction tailored to your specific needs and learning style."

As an immigrant myself, I understand the challenges of adapting to a new culture and learning a new language. This personal experience has made me a more empathetic teacher, especially when working with Hebrew speakers learning English.",
        "I know firsthand how it feels to navigate daily life, job applications, and social situations in a language that's not your mother tongue. This understanding shapes my teaching approach, making it more patient, culturally aware, and tailored to the specific challenges Hebrew speakers face when learning English."
